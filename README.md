# Digit Recognizer

A simple learning experience creating:

1. A single layer neural network (single_layer.py)
2. A multi layer neural network (multi_layer.py)
3. A convolutional neural network (convlutional.py)

The best performing will be submitted to kaggle.


Special Thanks to [Hvass-Labs][1] for a great into to TF NN. His guidance helped in developing these.
